**Section:** B13: Cotality Domain 3  
**Mentor:** Peter A Nagy, Lawrence Vulis

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  

Working with building geometry data in BigQuery, and learning difffernt goemtric function in BigQuery

---

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I believe our inverstigation for Quarter two in case of our cohort is predecied for us addresses the challenge of improving property-level data quality across county and state boundaries. This involves analyzing inconsistencies in land-use classifications and property attributes and developing scalable methods

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
In Quarter 1, the focus was mostly on geometry extraction and validation at a single-county scale (San Diego). Moving forward, I would expect the approach to multi-county or statewide analysis as that will be what our mentors expect from us

---

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I plan to take CSE 152A (Introduction to Computer Vision) next quarter, and I expect that course will provide new tools and knowledge that could be extremely useful for future Capstone work. In particular, I hope to apply computer vision and image-processing concepts
